# Nebula Server
A decentralized computing platform. 
Nebula lets users contribute computing power from their phones,tablets and/or computers, to do work for others - and get paid for work done.

This server receives and distributes tasks from Clients to Nodes, and receives completed results from Nodes for validation and re-packaging for Clients.
